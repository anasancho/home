# Project/Company Name: `home`<sup>1</sup>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44024208-944f38da-9ee4-11e8-9f89-6eacd8a03d31.png)

<sup>1</sup> **`home`** is our "working title"; we open to suggestions!
We have discussed crowd-sourcing the name from our community,
but for now, this is easier and it kinda "works" for what we are doing.
There is built-in "brand recognition"
in the common expression "_Working from **`home`**_".

<hr />

## URL: https://dwyl.com/home

#### Company URL

Note: this is a _suggestion_.
I intend to make this doc available as a "landing page" on
https://dwyl.com/home
If you have a better idea, please advise!
I don't have a "strong preference" was just being pragmatic.

## Description

> Describe your company in a sentence or two. `<input maxlength="60">`

We are a Female Founder-Focussed Co-Living/Learning Home [57 characters]

We have worked in the technology industry in several roles
from everything from non-profit and 2-10 person micro co
to 100k person mega-corp and high-growth startup: 100 >> 10k growth. <br />
We have worked in, advised and trained people for _several_ startups.
We feel we have a _grasp_ of what it takes to run a successful technology startup.
(_though we expect to gain significantly more wisdom on the subject through
  participating in Startup School and possibly YC's "main" program_)
We have lived the "digital nomad" (remote working) lifestyle and
know what the biggest challenges are.

We want to be on this stage in a a few years time
and we want to help accelerate the ascent of other female founders.

<hr />

## Vertical

We feel that the "vertical" category that most reflects our project
is "***community***" closely followed by "***diversity***".



There are **36 options** for "Vertical" on the Startup School form see:
https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/511#issuecomment-412265192

**`home`** does not "_neatly_ fit" into anyone of them
rather it encompasses several:
+ `<option value="7">Community</option>` because we are building a community.

+ `<option value="8">Consumer</option>` because our "product"
is "consumer" focussed; our customers are "consumers".

+ `<option value="10">Developer Tools</option>` because we will be building
several open source tools that will help other developers realise their ideas!

+ `<option value="11">Diversity</option>` because we are focussed on
ladies in tech and other under-represented groups.

+ `<option value="14">Education</option>` we are not building an "EdTech"
company, however we are giving people _access_ to peer-lead tech learning
which, from experience, can be _far_ more effective
than traditional schools/university for learning tech skills.

<!--
+ `<option value="20">Hardware</option>` we will be building all our
door-access hardware from scratch using open source hardware and software.
e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/door (_though this is not our "core product"_)
-->

+ `<option value="21">Healthcare</option>` because we are promoting
a sustainably healthy lifestyle and equipping people with strategies
to _get_ healthy for people who have poor habits.

+ `<option value="22">International Market</option>` because we
intend to be _global_.

+ `<option value="23">Jobs</option>` we will both _create_ jobs
(_where we employ people directly_)
and help train people with skills they need to _get_ jobs in tech.

+ `<option value="26">Moonshots / Hard Tech</option>` we feel that building
an App to help people engage with their community is solving a "Hard" problem.
It's not a "moonshot" but it is difficult to get _right_.

+ `<option value="27">Nonprofit</option>` we will be _profitable_
but not _focussed_ on profits. And Open Sourcing all our code/systems
means that _anyone_ can "copy" our model which means we
can multiply the (positive) impact.

+ `<option value="30">Security</option>` We will be building both virtual and
physical security systems. We are not "pitching" ourselves
as a "security company" however security _is_ at the "core" of everything we do!

+ `<option value="36">Travel</option>` last but not least
we _definitely_ qualify as a "travel" company because people will
come from all over the world to stay at **`home`**.
Our aim is for our App to include travel and "what to do/visit" advice.
It will transcend the physical locations (operated by us)
and be used _ubiquitously_ for human interaction
(_without data mining and Ads!_). Again, this is not the "focus" for MVP.

<hr />

## Make

### What is your company going to make? `<textarea maxlength="200">`

**`home`** is a female founder focussed co-living/learning house
where people live, learn & work on "something people want".
By-product: Mobile App for community, door-access, lights & resource sharing.
[197 chars]

> Getting this down to 200 characters is _hard_...!!

Had to cut:

We intend to use Wifi/BLE beacons to give ***location-contextual UI***
to the users so they get relevant info through the **`home`**
e.g: light switches, curtains, teleconference room bookings
and kitchen/bathroom availability.
People will share recipes (_public or private_)
and meal plans (_house-specific_) inviting others to partake in meals!

<hr />

## Why?

### Why did you pick this to work on? `<textarea maxlength="250">`

**`home`** is what we wish we had when we started in the tech industry.
A place to meet, live and learn with peers
and a mentoring/support network throughout our career.
We are passionate about fostering the next generation of tech
workers & founders.

<hr />

## Commitment: Full-time

#### Are you currently part-time or full-time on this startup?

Options available:
```html
<select class="select required" name="company[commitment]" id="company_commitment">
<option value=""></option>
--
  | <option value="full_time">Full Time (40+ hours a week)</option>
  | <option value="part_time">Part Time (20+ hours a week)</option>
  | <option value="other_commitment">Other</option></select>
```

If there was an option for "_double-full-time_" i.e. **80+** hours/week,
we would pick that. <br />
For the foreseeable future, **`home`** is our _life_!


## _Progress_: Idea

### Which of the following best describes your progress?

```html
<select class="select required" name="company[stage]" id="company_stage">
<option value=""></option>
--
  | <option value="nothing">Nothing Built</option>
  | <option value="idea">Idea/sketches</option>
  | <option value="mocks">Mocks/Renderings</option>
  | <option value="prototype">Prototype/pre-launch</option>
  | <option value="private_beta">Private Beta</option>
  | <option value="public_beta">Public Beta</option>
  | <option value="preorders">Taking Preorders</option>
  | <option value="launched">Launched</option></select>
```

Given that our project involves a physical building
which is still "_under construction_",
we intend to use the Startup School time to start building the Mobile App (PWA)
which will be used by the people _staying_ in **`home`**.

We expect the building works to be done by the end of September
and the first "MVP" members to join us in October 2018.

The option that most accurately reflects the progress of our App is "Idea".
There isn't really an option in the list for "building site".
But we have a team of professional construction workers and tradesmen
taking care of the physical building so we feel that part is "on track".



<hr />

## How Far Along?

### How far along are you? `<textarea maxlength="250">`

The first **`home`** building is 65% construction-complete.
(Architect designs & progress photos on website)
We have built several components of our Mobile App (PWA)
but do not yet have an MVP we can test with users;
we plan to make it during Startup School. [249 chars]


<hr />

## Incorporated: No

### Have you incorporated your company?* [yes/no]

For the purposes of the "Co-living" project,
we do not have a dedicated company for **`home`**.
Until now we have been funding it through operating cashflow/surplus
from our existing company (@dwyl) as well as personal equity.

We are open to advice whether we should form a new company
(_we are leaning towards a new company..._)
we have a "four-letter-dotcom" domain: [dwyl.com](https://dwyl.com)
and the corresponding "social accounts" e.g: https://twitter.com/dwyl
which we feel would be a "waste" to _abandon_.

If our advisors think we can "pivot" (repurpose) the `@dwyl` brand
we'd be happy to do that.

There is some "overlap", given that **`home`** is helping
people discover and _do_ what they love.





# tl;dr

We like to think of **`home`** as a "***Pre-YC***"
place to learn creative/coding skills,
discover like-minded people and focus on solving big problems.

**`home`** is _not_ a "coding bootcamp" like "FullStack Academy" (YC S12)
and it's not an AirBnB (YC W09) it's
more akin to a Recurse Center (YC S10) https://www.recurse.com/
(_self-directed learning_)
meets cost-effective "high-end hostel".
with _privacy_ and plenty of space to think, exercise and work.

Our aim is to help people have a solid foundation
to launch into a career in tech
either as an engineer or founder!

We believe that having a female-founder-focus
is _essential_ for achieving "balance" in the tech industry
and is congruent with YC's mission.

We are planning to have a "hack space" or "Design & Technology Lab"
which is a 50m<sup>2</sup> filled with prototyping tools/machines
including a Laser cutter, CNC machine, 3D printers and wide range of
tools for making furniture, electronics projects and other "hardware hacking".

_Please_ give us a space on Startup School
so that we can benefit from mentorship and
be part of your _incredible_ network.


_Thank you_!


<hr />

# WARNING: Below this point is "Work-in-Progress" for "internal purposes". 🚧

We have made it **`public`** in the interest of "transparency",
but _please_ don't read it if you are
in _any_ way "critical" of embryonic ideas that are not "polished" in a "deck".

<hr />

## Why?

![working-from-home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/43996896-071d1e66-9dc5-11e8-93e2-9a4b3fa000c9.png) <br />
http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html > Workplaces


## What?

The saying goes: **`home`** is "where the heart is". <br />
We intend to _extend_ this definition to include:

+ **`home`** is where you feel _welcome_, _loved_ and _happy_.
+ **`home`** is where you can _learn and flourish_
  in a "***safe space***".
+ **`home`** is where you can _focus_ on your health, nutrition and well-being.
+ **`home`** is where people go to get _work done_.
+ **`home`** is where you can practice making "_something people **want**._"


During Startup School we intend to build the **App**
to help us **_measure_ everything** in the **`home`** community.

Areas we are hoping to explore include:
+ "**Customer Acquisition**" - finding the like-minded people who
want to live, learn and work in a co-living environment.
+ Measuring and Optimising for _Happiness_ (_see: "**OMTM**" section below_)
+ **Promoting learning** and sharing of knowledge/skill without fear of
intimidation through "_brogrammer_" behaviour.
+ **Security Systems** both physical and virtual for accessing the building.
+ **Sleep, Nutrition & Exercise tracking**
to promote a healthy "_personal foundation_"
We have experience building apps in this space for others
e.g: https://github.com/healthlocker/healthlocker
+ **Share Responsibility** for resources and avoid "tragedy of the commons".

As you can tell from this list, we have "lots of ideas". <br />
We want/need _Help_/_Mentoring_ from a YC partner
to know where to focus our attention.



### Female Focussed?

We intend to direct all of our content towards female founders
because we feel they are an underserved group.
YC's demographics https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-demographics
indicate that fewer than 25% of startups have one or more female founders:

> "_Of the founders we funded in our most recent batch,
11.1% of the founders are women
(about 23% of the startups have one or more female founders),
3.7% of the founders are Hispanic, and 4% of the founders are Black. "
> "_The bad news, of course, is that applicant percentages
are low relative to the entire population._"

We want to be part of the solution to this:
https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/y-combinator-diversity-2017



This is a problem we have _personally_ felt while working in Tech.
And it's one our female members _continue_ to feel as tech
is still overwhelmingly male-dominated
and _still_ has "bad apples" spoiling it for others.



#### Will We _Exclude_ Men?


No, we have no intention of _excluding_ or making men
(_or people who identify as male or non-binary_) feel "_unwelcome_",
much to the contrary,
_everyone_ is welcome regardless gender, ethnicity/race, sex,
politics or religion.

The only _pre-requisites_ are that:
+ people are here to "be nice".
+ share knowledge/experience freely.
+ don't make others feel "uncomfortable" with what you say or do.
+ macho ("bro-like"/intimidating) behaviour will not be tolerated;
["_Brogrammers_"](https://www.google.com/search?q=brogrammer) need not apply.
see: https://github.com/dwyl/code-of-conduct

> "_Sexism in tech is real._" ~ Sam Altman
https://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups

Female founders and tech workers often feel "_unwelcome_"
in a male-dominated world, we are going address this _head on_.

From our experience in the Tech Industry,
both running Founders & Coders and Working as Developers/Engineers
in several companies,
we have seen/felt first-hand how a **_small minority_ of _men_**
are condescending/intimidating towards ladies and minorities,
we will address this



### One Metric That Matters ["OMTM"]: _Happiness_

> “_It really is true, the company will build
whatever the CEO decides to measure._” ~ Sam Altman
via: https://medium.com/how-to-start-a-startup/47-quotes-from-sam-altman-on-building-a-great-product-51aa656952ab

Our short-to medium-term metric is "_Happiness_".
We want to make "_Happiness_" our primary KPI because
we know that by measuring and optimising for happiness _first_
any other goals will be achievable.


We realise that "_Happiness_" is a subjective measure
however we intend to make it _quantifiable_
in the same way that there is a "World Happiness Report":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report
we intend to do that for our company/project
and make it available for others too!



This does not mean there won't be _disagreements_ and even _conflicts_.
What it means is that _everyone_ involved knows what we are "_optimising for_",
and can act accordingly.


We have already begun to make some progress on this.
see: https://github.com/dwyl/feedback
It's our _anonymous_ MVP on: https://dwyl-feedback.herokuapp.com/feedback/new
![feedback-form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44026238-4955d5ea-9eea-11e8-86b1-7e26ae69ea72.png)


A _variant_ on measuring Happiness is measuring the extent to which
people are "_Doing What You Love_".
We believe in this _strongly_ to the extent that our _current_ company
is called "DWYL" ... see: https://github.com/dwyl/start-here


The _reason_ we are not trying to measure "dwyl-ness"
is because sometimes to do something you love,
you have to _fund_ it doing a job you don't necessarily love.
PG put it best:

> "_The test of whether people love what they do is whether
they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it even if they
had to work at another job to make a living._"
"How To Do What You Love" http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html Paul Graham, 2006

Some of the people living/working at **`home`** will fall into the category
of "work at another job",
so measuring their overall happiness is a more accurate metric.


<br />

### Why "It Will _Never_ Work" (Risks and Mitigation)

<!--
I learned about adding a "Why You Should NOT Invest" section to a pitch
from reading "Orginals" by Adam Grant.
It puts people "off guard" if you *explicitly* identify your "weaknesses"
and shows that you have considered the "risks" and how to mitigate them.
-->

There are _several_ risks of creating a co-living home/community
any of which can "sink the ship", we need to be aware of and address them all.

From our background in "Enterprise Risk Management",
we are trained to think in terms of hyperbolic headlines
and worst-case scenarios.

This list is ordered in terms of their probability and potential impact:

+ Data miss-management leading to breach, GDPR fines and negative PR.
We intend to apply all the "best practices"
we have learned from building/auditing apps in the Finance and Travel sectors
where personal data protection is
Data will be encrypted
We wrote an example/tutorial on this.
See: https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-ecto-encryption-example
In addition to both field-level encryption and strong access control,
we intend to perform regular third-party (controlled) penetration tests,
both on-site and remotely to test our security.
Having a house that actively recruits hackers has both pros and cons,
we intend to leverage the pros by inviting our "white hat" personal friends
e.g: Adam Baldwin https://github.com/evilpacket
(head of security **@npm** and
"Security Bug Bounty Hunter") to visit
and hack on our _internal_ network.
Additionally we will setup a "Security Bug Bounty"
(_with responsible disclosure_)
via https://www.hackerone.com
once we have ironed out any "basic bugs" using our team and existing network.

+ Physical access security leading to loss of property.

+ Personal injury (_or death_) from using the facilities.

+ Descent into _chaos_ (_messiness and lack of hygiene_)
  e.g: LikeALittle's Hacker House: https://youtu.be/MAihXfHa7K8
  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4346049 Circle Inc? (YC W11?)


+ "Alcohol/Drugs-fueled Sex Scandal" ...
No Drugs or Alcohol allowed on the premises.
We don't "control" what people consume when they are _away_ from home,
we just have a rule that they don't bring/consume it within.
This is to avoid _any_ association with being a "party house"
and to prevent a _leading_ cause of personal injury and _death_: intoxication.
  + No Sex. This is enforced at [podshare.co](http://www.podshare.co) and
  avoids a whole _heap_ of issues we cannot _afford_ to face. `#NoMeansNo` ...

+ **Open Sourcing All Code**, won't that _invite competition_?!
We feel that the benefits of having
a **100% Open Source** Community Culture
is aided by and even _requires_ open-sourcing the code.
This will encourage people to contribute to improving the App(s)
which in turn promotes ownership and

+ It's **_not_ for everyone**.
We have been travelling and worked remotely
and we know how big the demand for tech-focussed co-living is; it's real.
Just look at
But we readily acknowledge that this is _not_ for everyone.
Read the comments on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmuy4zktBI
(_Note: we are **NOT** building a **hyper-expensive** zero-privacy
  sardine-can "pod sharing" at $50-60/night ...
  we are building a **spacious**, **quiet** and **clean**
"affordable luxury shared living" where we **chose** to share so we can meet
interesting people, learn from peers and do meaningful work_)

> If you can help us think of and address any other risks,
we would love to hear from you!

### Getting Traction: Revenue & Customer Feedback

In the short term we want to _focus_ on building our App.
In order to _test_ the App we need _users_.
To _get_ these users we intend to use the following channels:



#### MVP: AirBnB Listing

To generate **_initial_ demand**
(_and get "MVP customer feedback"_) we intend to use AirBnB.
We will keep the amount of detail on our AirBnB listing to a minimum
to "underpromise and over deliver"
and hopefully people will be _pleasantly_ surprised when they arrive.

We will incorporate the feedback of people who find us through AirBnB
into our App and ask people for reviews on Google, TripAdvisor and to post
pictures on their "Social".

We have experience of both listing and "consuming" on AirBnB.
(_see: "Experience in Real Estate?" section below_)


#### Digital Nomad Girls (DNG)

We are friends of **Jenny** at https://digitalnomadgirls.com
a network of female-only "Digital Nomads" (remote workers)
who either have their own micro-business
or work for someone else remotely. <br />
Reach: Fb: 8.8K, [Insta: 24.9k](https://www.instagram.com/digitalnomadgirls/),
Tw: 4.5k (August 2018).

We intend to offer places "at cost" to members of DNG
because they are _lovely_ people who share our vision
and we know they will help fuel our organic/social traffic
by mentioning (linking to) us on their travel blogs, Instagram and YouTube.


#### Our Existing Social Networks

Inês is a co-organiser of Ladies of Code (London)
https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK (3K members)
and has access to other female-focussed Meetup networks.
We intend to leverage these to find people who are able to work remotely,
and invite them to stay with and learn with us.


#### Nomad List

Once we have our _basic formula_ working,
we intend to _test_ running ads on https://nomadlist.com
Our hope is that we get enough "_organic_" demand
to not _need_ to run ads.
However given how niche/focussed Nomad List is,
we feel that if we need to generate targeted demand,
this is the route we will take.


#### Y Combinator _Network_

Our _ultimate_ aim is to be part of the Y Combinator Network
because we feel that YC is the best "filter" for the type of people
we want to attract to live, learn and work at **`home`**.

Longer term we plan to build _many_ instances of **`home`** around the world,
where prospective YC applicants can meet each other and
[form, storm norm & perform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)
in a controlled environment ***before*** they apply to YC.
And _current_ members of YC (both Europe and US founders)
can base their company and not have to _think_
about laundry, nutrition or bills;

We believe there is a _strong_ symbiosis between YC's Network and **`home`**.
<!-- don't know if we need to add this, don't want to sound desperado ..
and will _gladly_ accept equity investment in exchange for mentorship
and access to the vast network.
-->


## _Who?_

![ines-and-nelson](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4185328/44024346-f07ed4c6-9ee4-11e8-9abe-7739cf1dbd88.jpg)

Inês and Nelson went to the same _primary_ school.
They have been an "item" for 19 years (since age 14!),
business partners for 13 years
(2005 - 2007 and 2013 - present. )
and _married_ for 1 year.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44033702-247f8ee6-9f03-11e8-8b0f-23f498c043eb.png)



### Why Us?

> "_Let's **solve our own problem** and see where it goes_".﻿ <br />
~ Jessica Livingston : How to Build the Future
https://youtu.be/nFOC-cgIWaY?t=5m26s

We have started two companies together a Clothing Company
and an App Development Agency. Both bootstrapped. Both profitable.

We are using the operating surplus from **`@dwyl`** to bootstrap **`home`**.

#### Experience in Training/Coaching Female Founders & Tech Workers?

We have a decent amount of experience of training people from scratch
(_with no previous experience_) to get jobs as developers
or start their own companies.
![founders-and-coders-homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44028857-2fa67b0a-9ef3-11e8-93c4-c735bd79f2f9.png)


_Examples_ of companies founded/grown through Founders & Coders:
+ FatLama https://fatlama.com/ (YC S17) - online rental marketplace for equipment
founded by
+ Scrimba https://scrimba.com online coding learning and pair-programming environment
+ Personably

see: https://foundersandcoders.com/about/
![a-way-into-tech-industry-founders-coders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44007184-f71e0a2e-9e88-11e8-88e2-99261ddc5dc4.png)


#### Experience in Real Estate?

We have previously bought, renovated and rented out 3 homes and feel
we have learned on "small scale". All our property investments have been
cashflow positive.
In our existing rental properties we only have "young professionals"
who aren't "ready" to buy (either because they are establishing themselves
  or unsure if they want to live in the particular city long-term)
we consistently charge _below_ "market rate" and offer above average
fixtures/fittings and amenities. Our _below_ "market clearing price"
means we are _flooded_ with "applicants"
each time someone decides to "move on",
which means the other housemates get to chose from a wide pool of potential.
This has been a "win-win" strategy over the last 7 years and we intend to
adapt it to **`home`**.

This is a sample of _one_ of our AirBnB listings in London:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44030477-d6a1e598-9ef8-11e8-90f4-d0d3cbb7a1af.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44030597-243ebb8c-9ef9-11e8-8a61-8e36eca70242.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44030540-fd57f1b4-9ef8-11e8-9d06-7c1d5c654fb3.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44030560-0c4520ac-9ef9-11e8-816e-825c95c1b3d6.png)

Our listing is "unlisted" because the appartment is long-term rented
while we focus on setting up **`home`**.

To be clear: we don't want to be "landlords", we want to build a community
and be part of _solving_ the housing shortage, not _exacerbate_ it!

Our medium to long-term goal is that people who co-live in the **`home`**
can **co-_own_** the company thus the amount they pay each month
goes towards _ownership_ not "rent". We intend to _explore_ this option
further our 2nd year of operation;
once we have launched our 3rd or 4th **`home`**.

Both previous businesses have been profitable and had zero capital.

# RFS

After reading "Requests for Startups" http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs
we are convinced that our project qualifies for mentorship
in the Startup School program.

Let us highlight the categories which are applicable **`home`**:




## BRICK AND MORTAR 2.0

We are re-purposing an _abandoned_ single-family large (_by European standards_)
house and transforming it into something new.

We are making all of our plans, decisions and outcomes `public`
online https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/tree/master/braga
so that other people can learn from our mistakes/success
and



## EDUCATION


## DIVERSITY


## FUTURE OF WORK


## LONGEVITY AND ANTI-AGING

## SUPPORTING CREATORS


## TRANSPORTATION & HOUSING

Having a place where you can work without needing to _commute_
and where you have access to an electric bicycles and other
on-demand transport is the future.

While we are not directly addressing `TRANSPORTATION`,
we will make a car available to all members at each house we build.
Our plan is to have one or more electric car(s)



## UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND SOCIAL SERVICES


Once we have proved the initial model of **`home`**
with a successful App and _expanded_ to 5 locations,
we intend to hire a team member who will be responsible
for reaching out to and mentoring people are _especially_ vulnerable:
young adults from "broken homes", children of incarcerated, drug-dependent
or _dead_ parents and women who have been victims of domestic abuse.


We _already_ have a working relationship with Domestic Abuse charities
http://www.safelives.org.uk in the UK and http://www.cococi.org/fr/about-us
in Portugal.

Our aim will be to give women and young adults who have been subjected
to domestic violence a chance to live in a safe living environment
where they can learn skills, find work and start their own success stories!




# Other Areas Which Are Not Our _Primary_ Focus:

## A.I

We intend to use computer vision for physical access controls (door entry).
This will not be our "product" however we will "_assemble_"
the pieces

For this we will partner with our good friend (dwyl alum) **Nikhila Ravi**:
see: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilaravi / https://github.com/nikhilaravi
who co-organises http://opened.ai

## ROBOTICS

We intend to use robots for as much domestic work as possible
to both alleviate the burden of "chores" and
Initially this will be confined to a robotic vaccuum cleaner,
but
