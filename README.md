# `home` [working title]

**`home`** is "where the heart is". <br />
It _and_ where people go to get _work done_.

The app to track everything in the "home" community.

### Why "It Will _Never_ Work" (Risks and Mitigation)

There are _several_ risks of creating a co-living home/community
any of which can "sink the ship"

From our background in "Enterprise Risk Management",
we are trained to think in terms of hyperbolic headlines
and worst-case scenarios.

These are ordered in terms of their probability and potential impact:

+ Data miss-management leading to breach and GDPR

+ Physical access security leading to loss of property.

+ Personal injury (_or death_) from using the facilities.

+ Descent into _chaos_ (_messiness and lack of hygiene_)
  e.g: LikeALittle's Hacker House: https://youtu.be/MAihXfHa7K8

+ "Alcohol/Drugs-fueled Sex Scandal" ...
No Drugs or Alcohol allowed on the premises.
We don't "control" what people consume when they are _away_ from home,
we just have a rule that they don't bring/consume it within.
This is to avoid _any_ association with being a "party house"
and to prevent a _leading_ cause of personal injury and _death_: intoxication.


### Revenue Plans

To generate _initial_ demand we intend to use AirBnB.
We will keep the amount of detail on our AirBnB listing to a minimum
to "underpromise and over deliver"
and hopefully people will be _pleasantly_ surprised when they arrive.

### One Metric That Matters ["OMTM"]: _Happiness_


This does not mean there won't be _disagreements_ and even _conflicts_.
What it means is that _everyone_ involved knows what we are "_optimising for_",
and can act accordingly.
