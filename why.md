# Why?

> As usual, if you are critical of "incomplete" ideas, please don't read this.

Our reasoning for _why_ we want to build a ***`@home`***
where people in the @dwyl community can live, learn, get/stay well
and work on something meaningful is simple: we want this for ourselves.

When we graduated from High School / University,
there was no place we could go/live
that was focussed on health/wellness
and where we could learn the skills
we needed for the 21<sup>st</sup> century
surrounded by _like-minded motivated_ people.

If ***`@home`*** had _existed_
when we left our parents houses
and/or when we graduated from University,
we would have jumped at the opportunity!

We are _building_ what we _wish_ already existed!

## A _Sure_ Sign We are "Onto Something"

As an entrepreneur,
one of the _best_ signs
that you have an _innovative_ idea
is that _some_ people just don't _get_ it.
No matter how much you try to _explain_ it to them,
they simply don't have the imagination/empathy
to understand that even though _they_ are not the "_target user_",
there are _thousands/millions_ of people
who _do_ wan the product/service
you are creating.

> For **example**:
When Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk
pitched their idea of an "_Air Bed and Breakfast_"
to Fred Wilson in 2009,
he _loved_ them as founders,
but tried to convince them to work on a different idea.
Paul Graham, arguably one of the greatest startup investors,
did not "get" the idea of renting
a bed in your own home to a _stranger_ through a website.
Paul asked the founders the following question: <br />
> “_People are actually doing this? Why? **What’s wrong with them**?_” <br />
8 years later AirBnB is _by far_ the most valuable company
in the YCombinator portfolio:

Over the last year
we have _verbally_ explained
the idea of ***`@home`***
to _many_ people.
_Most_ of those people
have _immediately_ understood
and _loved_ the idea.
But a _handful_ have been _confused_ by it.

One person in _particular_,
who will remain nameless to avoid "embarrassing" them,
_really_ didn't "_get_" the idea at _all_!
They only understood the idea in terms
they could _already_ envision.
They would say "_it's a **hostel**_" ...

They simply did not have the _imagination_
to _understand_ the concept of
"_co-living_",
"_location-independent working_"
or "_life-long learning_".
It is _inconceivable_ to them that anyone
would _voluntarily want_ to live
with like-minded and _interesting_ people.
It's equally _unimaginable_
that people would _want_ to learn new things
or do something they _love_ for a living.

The person lives in a _mansion_
of similar size to the Braga ***`@home`***
and has an _empty_ (_lonely/sad_) life
they attempt to fill with TV, shopping and gossip.
No real _substance_.  Nothing _creative_, innovative or original.

The person has been working the same paper-pushing job
for _several_ years and _complains_ about it _constantly_.
Each time they complain about their "boss" or their lack of pay increase,
we say: "_**quit** your job_!"
(_the person has more than enough money to retire or retrain,
  but is **terrified** of being alone with their own thoughts,
  so instead relies on having a job to keep their days/mind occupied._)

The fact is this:
if some people don't _immediately_ understand your idea,
that's a _really good_ sign!
If _everyone_ gets it,
then it is not very original.

### Why We _MUST_ Live & Work `@home`

The person does not "_get_" what we are trying to build
keeps _insisting_ that we (Inês and I)
should _not_ live in the home when it's ready.
They keep saying that we should rent/buy an apartment nearby.
They don't _understand_ that we are trying to build a _community_,
_not_ a "passive income business".
They don't _understand_ the _first_ principal of design thinking process:
empathy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking#Empathy
Designing a home for someone _`else`_ to live in
(_without living in it ourselves_)
will not be anywhere _near_ as effective
as actually _living_ there _full-time_
so that we can feel any "_pain points_" first-hand.

> The biggest problem with _existing_
developer-lead co-living communities -
such as "**The Collective**" in London
which an ex-resident described as
"***Horrible, horrible place***."
see: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16911318 -
is that they are designed by people
who _don't_ live in the building/community.



Their lack of empathy is due to the fact
that they have _never_ done
_any_ creative work in their lives.
People who do not _want_ to empathise with others,
will _only_ see the world through their own lens.
They _chose_ not to _understand_
that there are _many_ people
who do not share their perspective.
Yet, by _definition_ the world
is _full_ people who do _not_ share your _exact_ point of view.
Places with only _one_ view point are
