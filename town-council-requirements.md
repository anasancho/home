## Braga Town Council Documentation :bookmark_tabs:

If you're building a house from scratch or doing renovations that require
changes to the _outside_ of the house (anything that changes the facade) in
Portugal, you will need to submit project plans for approval to the town council.

> If you have architects and a single contractor handling all of the works, both
of whom know how to interact with the town council and have agreed to be in
charge of submitting and pursuing all your approvals, you do not need to worry
about the below. We had to do all of this as our contractor turned out to be
more of a foreman than a full contractor - we learnt a lot!

The first step is to get architectural approval for your changes - you should
make sure you have architects who are able to manage this process for you.

Once this has been approved, you will need to hand in the projects for all of
your 'specialties' :wrench: :nut_and_bolt: (`especialidades` in Portuguese)
such as plumbing, electrical, etc. for approval.

These _can_ be handed in at the same time as your architectural project but if
you have the luxury of time, you are better off getting architectural approval
_first_ (be prepared to wait between 2 and 9 months for approval - ours took
9 months after one rejection of our original roof garden plans).  
This means that you can hand that in as soon as it's ready and get
the process started without having to wait for the `especialidades` to be
completed. If there are any issues with the architecture project, you may need to re-do
the `especialidades` anyway so the sooner you find out about this the better.

This information is _specifically relevant to the kind of work **we** are doing
and to the **Braga** town council at the time of writing (2018/2019)_.   
Whereas it may be illustrative of the kind of processes to expect at other
Portuguese town councils, this should not be taken as a given and you must
seek out additional information for yourself (even in Braga).


## General Points
+ Each time you hand anything in, you will need to fill in a `requerimento`,
i.e a standard form that tells the council what it is you're handing in
+ Keep hold of _all_ the documents you hand in and keep them handy in an
organised folder, they _will_ come in handy, even if only to look up information
and process numbers quickly (but most likely because there will be some
obscure question that you can't answer but that the clerks at the town council
can answer in seconds with your document history)
+ At the time of writing, you can find all of these `requerimento` forms in the
'Apoio ao Cidadão' section of the council's website:

Finally, be aware that every time you hand in documentation, you will be expected
to pay a fee for doing so.

## Especialidades
If you do hand in your architectural plans for approval first, you'll get a
letter from the council with a list of :wrench: :nut_and_bolt: projects you need
to hand in (they are not specific to your property) and a deadline by which to do so.  
If you're handing everything in at once (or haven't received the letter yet), you
can check what you're expected to include in the form that you hand in with the
projects. For Braga, it's this one:
[![requerimento-especialidades](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4185328/55279305-6673f100-530f-11e9-94bf-264c45af8bc8.png)](https://www.cm-braga.pt/pt/0502/municipio/camara-municipal/apoio-ao-cidadao/requerimentos/item/item-1-7861/download)

Getting the documents together was extremely time consuming not only because
it's essentially a process of herding cats, but because the Braga town council
has some very specific rules technical rules around the documents,
from format to naming conventions (more on these [below](#the-gotchas)).

***All documents (including the signed and scanned `requerimento` form)
must be handed in on a CD*** as well as a hard copy of the signed `requerimento`.

Before you are able to hand _any_ of your documents in, the documents on your
CD are run through a program to check they meet the technical requirements
(see below). If a single one of the documents on your CD fails the
technical check, they are all rejected and _there is no record of you having
attempted to hand these in_.

**If you have been given a deadline by the council
to hand these in, start preparing them _well_ in advance** as it's unusual that
they all get accepted on the first attempt. This also means that even if you
don't have all your documentation ready yet, if you have any doubts about whether
the projects you do have being correct, you can take them to the council and get
them to check through them (this was very useful for us).

With each of the `especialidades` you can go one of two ways:
+ Present the full project with all of the required support documents (the document
  mentioned below which gives you the codes for each document in each area
  - plumbing, gas, electrical, fire safety, etc - will be a good guide for expectations)
+ Present a **request for an exemption** for handing in the project
  + This does not require a "requerimento" and is a PDF document that you will
  need an engineer or architect to write for you and include in your CD
  (even if just to say "This isn't required because no changes are being made")
  + You will still need a couple of other support documents from said engineer to
  prove they are qualified professionals (like insurance and their membership of
  the 'Ordem de engenheiros'), but these are standard and they will know which
  ones they are
  + Each one of these will still set you back around €100-150 as they are essentially
  signing on to be accountable for the lack of a project (and it's easy :moneybag:)
