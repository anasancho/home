## Braga Town Council Documentation :bookmark_tabs:

If you're building a house from scratch or doing renovations that require
changes to the _outside_ of the house (anything that changes the facade) in
Portugal, you will need to submit project plans for approval to the town council.

> If you have architects and a single contractor handling all of the works, both
of whom know how to interact with the town council and have agreed to be in
charge of submitting and pursuing all your approvals, you do not need to worry
about the below. We had to do all of this as our contractor turned out to be
more of a foreman than a full contractor - we learnt a lot!

The first step is to get architectural approval for your changes - you should
make sure you have architects who are able to manage this process for you.

Once this has been approved, you will need to hand in the projects for all of
your 'specialties' :wrench: :nut_and_bolt: (`especialidades` in Portuguese)
such as plumbing, electrical, etc. for approval.

These _can_ be handed in at the same time as your architectural project but if
you have the luxury of time, you are better off getting architectural approval
_first_ (be prepared to wait between 2 and 9 months for approval - ours took
9 months after one rejection of our original roof garden plans).  
This means that you can hand that in as soon as it's ready and get
the process started without having to wait for the `especialidades` to be
completed. If there are any issues with the architecture project, you may need to re-do
the `especialidades` anyway so the sooner you find out about this the better.

This information is _specifically relevant to the kind of work **we** are doing
and to the **Braga** town council at the time of writing (2018/2019)_.   
Whereas it may be illustrative of the kind of processes to expect at other
Portuguese town councils, this should not be taken as a given and you must
seek out additional information for yourself (even in Braga).


## General Points
+ Each time you hand anything in, you will need to fill in a `requerimento`,
i.e a standard form that tells the council what it is you're handing in
+ Keep hold of _all_ the documents you hand in and keep them handy in an
organised folder, they _will_ come in handy, even if only to look up information
and process numbers quickly (but most likely because there will be some
obscure question that you can't answer but that the clerks at the town council
can answer in seconds with your document history)
+ At the time of writing, you can find all of these `requerimento` forms in the
'Apoio ao Cidad√£o' section of the council's website:

Finally, be aware that every time you hand in documentation, you will be expected
to pay a fee for doing so.
